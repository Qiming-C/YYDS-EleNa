# YYDS-Elevation Gain Navigation 

Elena is a full stack application that runs on Express. You can select the start and end points and then calculate the minimum elevation gain or maximum elevation gain by limiting the percentage of the shortest path. The app is used by runners, bikers, walkers and drivers. Users have different options to decide if they want to find a smoother path or a steeper path.

## Build

Use `npm` to install all necessary dependencies

```shell
npm install
```



## Run the server



```shell
npm start
```

Once log shows `data is loaded,  you can visit localhost:3000 to make request through our front-end page or you can test the endpoint with **Postman** , or **Curl**



## Run the test

We provide two commands to run the test suites which produce the line coverage report power by [Istanbul](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc). 



```
npm run coverage-html
```

This command will run the test suites and generate the report in `coverage` folder.

```
npm run coverage-text
```

This command will run the test suites and generate the report in the console with plain text
